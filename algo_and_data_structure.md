# Data Structure and Algorithm Recap
By the end of the day, all data structures and algorithm questions can be break down to two base structure:
linked list and array. Tree, graph, Hash table, Queue, Stack, alll of them can be represented with the two basic structure.

### Tools & Materials :
- LeetCode Explore hase a Learn section, features Array and linkedlist
- Github Repo: fucking-algorithm

## Linked List


## Array



## Graph

Following two are the most commonly used representations of a graph.
- Adjacency Matrix
- Adjacency List


## Hash Table


## Tree Traversal
- Inorder (Left, Root, Right)
- Preorder (Root, Left, Right)
- Postorder (Left, Right, Root)
